Basic example
=============

The most basic :code:`fabfile.py` you can use with the Fabricio is something like this:

.. code:: python

    from fabricio import docker, tasks
    
    
    nginx = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Container(
            name='nginx',
            image='nginx:stable',
            options={
                'publish': '80:80',
            },
        ),
        hosts=['user@example.com'],
    )
    
Type :code:`fab --list` in your terminal to see available Fabric commands:

::

    Available commands:

        nginx           full service deploy (prepare -> push -> upgrade)
        nginx.rollback  rollback service to a previous version (migrate-back -> revert)

Finally, to deploy such configuration you simply have to execute following bash command:

.. code:: bash

    fab nginx

See also Fabricio `examples and recipes`_.

.. _examples and recipes: https://github.com/renskiy/fabricio/tree/master/examples/

Requirements
============

Local
-----

- Python 2.6+ or Python 3.4+*
- (optional) Docker 1.9+ for building Docker images

\* `Fabric3`_ is used for compatibility with Python 3

.. _Fabric3: https://github.com/mathiasertl/fabric/

Remote
------

- sshd
- Docker 1.9+
- Docker 1.12+ for using Docker services

Install
=======

.. code:: bash

    pip install fabricio
    
Note for macOS users
--------------------

Because of Python 2 on macOS marked as system component you can't upgrade its modules which are trying to be upgraded during the Fabricio install (e.g. ``six`` and ``setuptools``). Instead, you can try to install last version of Python 2 using `Homebrew`_:

.. code:: bash

    brew install python2

and then:

.. code:: bash

    pip2 install fabricio

.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh

Roles and infrastructures
=========================

You can define as many roles and infrastructures as you need. The following example shows 'production' and 'staging' configurations for two-roles deploy configuration:

.. code:: python

    from fabric import colors, api as fab
    from fabricio import docker, tasks


    @tasks.infrastructure
    def staging():
        fab.env.roledefs.update(
            balancer=['user@staging.example.com'],
            web=['user@staging.example.com'],
        )


    @tasks.infrastructure(color=colors.red)
    def production():
        fab.env.roledefs.update(
            balancer=['user@balancer.example.com'],
            web=['user@web1.example.com', 'user@web2.example.com'],
        )

    balancer = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Container(
            name='balancer',
            image='registry.example.com/nginx:balancer',
            options={
                'publish': ['80:80', '443:443'],
                'volume': '/etc/cert:/etc/cert:ro',
            },
        ),
        roles=['balancer'],
    )

    web = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Container(
            name='web',
            image='registry.example.com/nginx:web',
            options={
                'publish': '80:80',
                'volume': '/media:/media',
            },
        ),
        roles=['web'],
    )

Here is the list of available commands:

::

    Available commands:

        production          select production infrastructure to run task(s) on
        production.confirm  automatically confirm production infrastructure selection
        staging             select staging infrastructure to run task(s) on
        staging.confirm     automatically confirm staging infrastructure selection
        balancer            full service deploy (prepare -> push -> upgrade)
        balancer.rollback   rollback service to a previous version (migrate-back -> revert)
        web                 full service deploy (prepare -> push -> upgrade)
        web.rollback        rollback service to a previous version (migrate-back -> revert)

'production' and 'staging' are available infrastructures here. To deploy to a particular infrastructure just provide it before any other Fabric command. For example:

.. code:: bash

    fab staging balancer web

Tags
====

Almost every Fabricio command takes optional argument 'tag' which means Docker image tag to use when deploying container or service. For instance, if you want to deploy specific version of your application you can do it as following:

.. code:: bash

    fab app:release-42

By default, value for tag is taken from Container/Service Image.

Also it is possible to completely (and partially) replace registry/account/name/tag/digest of image to deploy:

.. code:: bash

    fab app:registry.example.com/registry-account/app-image:release-42
    fab app:nginx@sha256:36b0181554913b471ae33546a9c19cc80e97f44ce5e7234995e307f14da57268

Rollback
========

To return container or service to a previous version execute command :code:`fab app.rollback`.

Idempotency
===========

Fabricio always tries to skip unnecessary container/service update. However, update can be forced by adding ``force=yes`` parameter:

.. code:: bash

    fab app.deploy:force=yes
    
Private Docker registry
=======================

It is often when production infrastructure has limited access to the Internet or your security policy does not allow using of public Docker image registries. In such case Fabricio offers ability to use private Docker registry which can be used also as an intermediate registry for the selected infrastructure. To use this option you have to have local Docker registry running within your LAN and also Docker client on your PC. If you have Docker installed you can run up Docker registry locally by executing following command:

.. code:: bash

    docker run --name registry --publish 5000:5000 --detach registry:2

When your local Docker registry is up and run you can provide custom ``registry`` which will be used as an intermediate Docker registry accessed via reverse SSH tunnel:

.. code:: python

    from fabricio import docker, tasks

    nginx = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Container(
            name='nginx',
            image='nginx:stable-alpine',
            options={
                'publish': '80:80',
            },
        ),
        registry='localhost:5000',
        ssh_tunnel='5000:5000',
        hosts=['user@example.com'],
    )

List of commands in this case updated with additional commands which were hidden before:

::

    nginx.prepare   download Docker image from the original registry
    nginx.push      push downloaded Docker image to intermediate registry
    nginx.upgrade   upgrade service to a new version (backup -> pull -> migrate -> update)

See also `Hello World`_ example for more details.

.. _Hello World: https://github.com/renskiy/fabricio/tree/master/examples/hello_world/#ssh-tunneling
    
Building Docker images
======================

Using Fabricio you can also build Docker images from local sources and deploy them to your servers. This example shows how this can be set up:

.. code:: python

    from fabricio import docker, tasks

    app = tasks.ImageBuildDockerTasks(
        service=docker.Container(
            name='app',
            image='registry.example.com/registry-account/app-image:latest-release',
        ),
        hosts=['user@example.com'],
        build_path='.',
    )

Commands list for :code:`ImageBuildDockerTasks` is same as for :code:`DockerTasks` with provided custom registry. The only difference is that 'prepare' builds image instead of pulling it from image's registry.

Docker services
===============

Fabricio can work with Docker services:

.. code:: python

    from fabricio import docker, tasks

    nginx = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Service(
            name='nginx',
            image='nginx:stable',
            options={
                'publish': '8080:80',
                'replicas': 3,
            },
        ),
        hosts=['user@manager'],
    )

Docker stacks
=============

Docker stacks are also supported (available since Docker 1.13):

.. code:: python

    from fabricio import docker, tasks

    nginx = tasks.DockerTasks(
        service=docker.Stack(
            name='my-web-app',
            options={
                'compose-file': 'my-docker-compose.yml',
            },
        ),
        hosts=['user@manager'],
    )
